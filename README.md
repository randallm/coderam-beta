coderam-beta
============

Coderam Beta is a Flask webapp that interacts with the GitHub and Wikipedia APIs to provide details on open source software projects on one easy-to-digest page. (140 character pitch: *Wolfram Alpha for code*) I build this at [SF Code Day](http://sf.codeday.org/) Feb. 2013, and it won me the Best Application award!

I'm not going to abandon this project just yet. It's a good base to start on in building a Chrome extension, for example... or at least, it will be after some refactoring. (This isn't the best or most elegant piece of code I've ever written, but that's to be expected after ~24hrs of non-stop coding :smiling_imp:)
