coderam-beta
============

Coderam Beta is a Flask webapp that interacts with the GitHub and Wikipedia APIs to provide details on open source software projects on one easy-to-digest page. (140 character pitch: *Wolfram Alpha for code*) I build this at [SF Code Day](http://sf.codeday.org/) Feb. 2013, and it won me Best Application!

I'm not going to abandon this project just yet. It's a good base to start on in building a Chrome extension, for example... or at least, it will be after some refactoring. (This isn't the best or most elegant piece of code I've ever written :smiling_imp:)

Oh, and those API keys hardcoded into the views? I took the trouble to manually reset them. Don't even bother trying them.
